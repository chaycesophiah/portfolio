        <h2> About Me</h2>

        <hr>

        <p>I’m Chayce, I’m 15 and I go to Saint Gertrude High School. I’m an only child.

        <p>I like to get involved with as many things as I can in school. In middle school I participated in the
            environmental action team, we helped our school look more green and I really enjoyed being in a club that
            took the time to appreciate the nature around us. I also played on the basketball team, I wasn’t the best
            but it was nice having a sport to play and I loved being a part of a supportive team and supporting others.
            I was in the dissection club, we dissected a lot of animals including, cow eyes, baby sharks, frogs, and
            more. I was also part of the drama club which I loved very much. I love musical theater very much so getting
            to be a part of different plays that my school put on was very fun. I was a part of Madagascar, and was
            going to be a part of hairspray but covid hit and that was over. I was a dancer in Madagascar, I was a
            steak. I was a part of our speak up club, our job was to spread positivity around the school and just be
            people that others can talk to. I also attend a prejudice awareness summit through the speak up club. We
            also did a lot of volunteer work with the speak up club. I’m pretty sure I’ve been on honor roll throughout
            middle school but that did shift when high school started

        <h2> My Work </h2>

        <hr>
        <p>I've worked at Jade Multicultural salon for an internship in summer 2021. I enjoyed working at the salon to
            better my people skills and getting used to having a job in general. I've worked on a movie as an extra the
            movie is called Tapawingo (tbd) in summer 2021. I also gained a lot while I was on set for the movie, I got
            to see the behind the scenes and it made me love the film industry more. I got to meet a lot of cool people
            who have the same interests as me. I also participate in Girls for a change ambassador program(2021-now) and
            girl action team(now). </p>
